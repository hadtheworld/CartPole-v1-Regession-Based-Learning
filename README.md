# CartPole-v1-Regession-Based-Learning
In this project I have used neural networks to train a regression based model for "CartPole-v1" in gym Module by OpenAI, with a custom fit function, using e-Greedy approach, Bellman Equation(Q-Network) to find reward values at a particular state, Temporal Difference as loss functions and adam as the optimizer
